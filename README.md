### Description: 
This project is a story driven website, featuring a few mini ‘games’, focused on the topic of radiation waste and containment. You play as a worker at a nuclear power plant and you run through the events of a reactor meltdown happening during your average power worker shift. Alongside the story you are playing, you get to learn some interesting bits of information about nuclear waste containment and its impact on the environment and the adverse health effects of excess exposure. I wanted to incorporate the campy game aspects of old outdated flash simulator featuring some quiz mockups and a falling sand simulator.
